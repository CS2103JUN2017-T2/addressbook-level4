_Figure 2.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/multitasky/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EventListPanel`, `DeadlineListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/multitasky/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component

* Handles user input through the `CommandBox`.
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` changes.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Adding an entry: `add`

Adds an entry to the active tasks +
Format: `add ENTRY_NAME [/on | /at | /from DATE_TIME_A] [/to | /by DATE_TIME_B] [/every day | week | month | year [NUM_TIMES | /until END_DATE_TIME]] [/tag TAG_1 TAG_2...]`

****
* If no date is specified, the entry will contain no date information and automatically be classified under `floating entry`
* `/on`, or `at` can be used to create an `event entry`. The default value of 1 hour will be used to set the ending datetime.
* `/from` should be used in conjunction with `/to` for `event entry` that needs adjustable ending datetime.
* `/by` can be used to create `deadline entry`.
* Please be reminded that `DATE_TIME` must contain both date and time fields as described in Command Format above.
* `/every` can be used as an optional command to create recurring tasks.
* `/tag` can be used as an optional command to tag your entries.
****

*Defaults from `config.json`*: +

* The default value for events can be found as `addDurationHours`.
* If neither `NUM_TIMES` nor `END_DATE_TIME` for a recurring entry is specified, `recurringNumTimes` is used for the number of recurring events to add to MultiTasky.

Examples:

* `add dinner with parents /from friday 6pm /to friday 9pm /tag family`
* `add go to the gym /on monday 10am /every week /tag exercise, activities`
* `add project submission /by 5/7/17 10:00 /tag school`
* `add write novel /tag bucketlist`
* `add clean up room`

```

=== Editing an entry : `edit`

Edits an existing entry in the active list. +
Format: `edit [KEYWORD_1 KEYWORD_2...] | [/event | /deadline | /float INDEX] [/name NEW_ENTRY_NAME] [/on | /at | /from DATE_TIME_A] [/to | /by DATE_TIME_B] [/every day | week | month | year [NUM_TIMES | /until STOP_DATE] [/tag TAG_1 TAG_2...]`

****
* There are two ways to select an entry to edit: searching by `KEYWORD`, or specifying the `INDEX`.
** The keyword searches both the entry name and tags, and a found entry must match all keywords.
** The search must only produce one entry to modify. If multiple entries are found to match the keyword no entries will be modified.
** The search will be done on `active`.
** The index refers to the index number shown in the last active entry listing. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional data fields to be edited must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values. If that field is not provided, the existing values are not changed.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the entry will be removed and replaced with the new tags: *adding of tags is not cumulative*.
[NOTE]
You can remove all of the entry's tags by typing `/tag` without specifying any tags after it.
****

*Defaults from `config.json`*: +

* If neither `NUM_TIMES` nor `STOP_DATE` for a recurring entry is specified, `recurringNumTimes` is used for the number of recurring events to add to MultiTasky.

Examples:

* `edit /event 1 /on saturday 6pm` +
Edits the 1st entry of event list to take place on the coming Saturday at 6pm, for a duration set by `addDurationHours`.
* `edit /deadline 2 /every week 3 /tag` +
Edits the 2nd entry in deadline list to take place every week for 3 weeks including its current occurence, and clears all its existing tags.
* `edit zoo outing /on 20/9/17 12:00` +
Edits the entry matching "zoo" and "outing" to take place on 20 September, 12pm. If there are multiple entries that match the keywords, no entries are modifies.

```

=== Deleting an entry : `delete`

Deletes the specified entry from the active entries list. +
Format: `delete [KEYWORD_1 KEYWORD_2...] | [/event | /deadline | /float INDEX]`

****
* There are two ways to select an entry to delete: searching by `KEYWORD`, or specifying the `INDEX`.
** The keyword searches both the entry name and the tags, and a found entry must match all keywords.
** The search will be done on `active`.
** The index refers to the index number shown in the last active entry listing. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* Deleting an entry moves it from the `active` list to the `bin`.
* If multiple entries are found using the keywords, all found entries will be listed, and the user will be prompted to confirm that they want to delete all of those entries.
****

Examples:

* `list` +
`delete 2` +
Deletes the 2nd entry in the active list.
* `delete pasta dinner` +
Deletes all entries in the active list that matches "pasta" and "dinner" in the name or tag.
