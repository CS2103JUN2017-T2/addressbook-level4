_Figure 2.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/multitasky/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EventListPanel`, `DeadlineListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/multitasky/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component

* Handles user input through the `CommandBox`.
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` changes.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

==== PowerMatch

image::PowerMatchClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.6.1 : Structure of the PowerMatch Feature_

PowerMatch is the algorithm that powers the command autocomplete as well as PowerSearch. When checking if a given input matches a potential match, it can perform the following checks:

* Substring check - if the input is a substring of the potential match
* Acronym check - if the input characters represent an acronym of a series of words
* Permutation check - if the input characters permutated in a different way produce a match
* Additional/wrong characters check - if the input with characters changed/removed produces a match

PowerMatch allows the developer to specify the matching level for better control of the number of results.

=== Adding an entry: `add`

Adds an entry to the active tasks +
Format: `add ENTRY_NAME [<on | at | from> START_DATETIME] [<to | by> END_DATETIME] [tag TAG_1 TAG_2...]`

****
* If no date is specified, the entry will contain no date information and automatically be classified under `floating entry`
* `by` is used to create `deadline entry`.
* `on`, or `at` can be used to create an `event entry`. The default value of 1 hour will be used to set the ending datetime.
* `from` should be used in conjunction with `to` for `event entry` that needs adjustable ending datetime.
* You may use multiple flags to replace the previous flags if you come to realise mid-typing that you've entered the wrong information. e.g `add project deadline by tomorrow tag school finals by next week` will use `next week` as the deadline instead of `tomorrow` because the last flag to indicate end time is `by next week`.
* `tag` can be used as an optional command to tag your entries.
[NOTE]
Shortcut to add a full day event, simply use the same start datetime and end datetime. e.g. `add work from tomorrow to tomorrow`.
****

*Defaults from `preferences.json`*: +

* The default value for events can be found as `defaultDurationHour`.

Examples:

* `add dinner with parents from friday 6pm to 9pm tag family`
* `add go to the gym from monday 10am to 11am tag exercise activities`
* `add project submission by 5/7/2017 10:00 tag school`
* `add write novel tag bucketlist`
* `add clean up room`

```

=== Listing all entries : `list`

Displays a list of entries sorted by datetime. +
Format: `list [archive | bin | all] [reverse | upcoming] [from START_DATETIME] [to END_DATETIME]`

****
* By default the active entries will be listed.
* The `archive` and `bin` flags are to list the archived and deleted entries respectively.
* The `from` and `to` flags are used to specify a time period that only entries that fall within this period are shown. If `to` is specified but not `from`, then all the entries up to the later time bound are shown.
* The `reverse` flag lists entries in reverse order, starting from the entry furthest in the future. This does not alter the ordering of floating tasks.
* The `upcoming` flag lists entries in the future first, with the first upcoming entry at the top. Past entries are moved to the bottom of the list.
****

Examples:

* `list`
* `list to 10pm today`
* `list upcoming`
* `list from tomorrow 8am to tomorrow 5pm`

```
###### \UserGuide.adoc
``` adoc
=== Editing an entry : `edit`

Edits an existing entry in the active list. +
Format: `edit <KEYWORD_1 KEYWORD_2...> | <<event | deadline | float> INDEX> [name NEW_ENTRY_NAME] [<on | at | from> NEW_START_DATETIME] [<to | by> NEW_END_DATETIME] [<tag TAG_1 TAG_2...> | <addtag TAG_1 TAG_2...> ]`

****
* There are two ways to select an entry to edit: searching by `KEYWORD`, or specifying the `INDEX`.
** The keyword searches both the entry name and tags, and a found entry must match all keywords.
** The search must only produce one entry to modify. If multiple entries are found to match the keyword no entries will be modified.
** The search will be done on `active`.
** The index refers to the index number shown in the last active entry listing. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional data fields to be edited must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values. If that field is not provided, the existing values are not changed.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the entry will be removed and replaced with the new tags while using tag.
* To add on cumulative tags, simply use `addtag` instead.
[NOTE]
You can remove all of the entry's tags by typing `edit entryname tag` without specifying any tags after it.
****

Examples:

* `edit event 1 on saturday 6pm` +
Edits the 1st entry of event list to have starting datetime on the coming Saturday at 6pm.

* `edit deadline 2 tag` +
Edits the 2nd entry in deadline list to clear all its existing tags.

* `edit float 1 by tonight` +
Edits the 1st entry of floating tasks to become deadline with datetime 'tonight'.

* `edit zoo outing on 9/20/2017 12:00` +
Edits the entry matching "zoo" and "outing" to take place on 20 September, 12pm. If there are multiple entries that match the keywords, no entries are modified.

```
###### \UserGuide.adoc

=== Deleting an entry : `delete`

Deletes the specified entry from the active entries list. +
Format: `delete <KEYWORD_1 KEYWORD_2...> | <<event | deadline | float> INDEX>`

****
* There are two ways to select an entry to delete: searching by `KEYWORD`, or specifying the `INDEX`.
** The keyword searches both the entry name and the tags, and a found entry must match all keywords.
** The search will be done on `active`.
** The index refers to the index number shown in the last active entry listing. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* Deleting an entry moves it from the `active` list to the `bin`.
* If multiple entries are found using the keywords, all found entries will be listed, and the user will be prompted to confirm that they want to delete all of those entries.
****

Examples:

* `list` +
`delete 2` +
Deletes the 2nd entry in the active list.
* `delete pasta dinner` +
Deletes all entries in the active list that matches "pasta" and "dinner" in the name or tag.

```
###### \UserGuide.adoc

=== Command Autocomplete
Autocomplete functionality is enabled when entering commands. Simply press the `tab` key and MultiTasky will attempt to correct/complete words that you've typed so far. +
Here are some examples you can try:

* Autocomplete will only complete your input if it's sure that that's the word you want.
** Type `e` and press `tab`. Notice how nothing has changed as there are multiple possibilities for completing this input.
** Now add an `x` behind `e` to get `ex` and now it completes to `exit` when you press `tab`.
* You can also ask Autocomplete to show you the possibilities that it has found.
** Try typing `is` and pressing `tab` once. The word is not completed. Then press `tab` twice quickly, which shows that `is` can be corrected to `history` or `list`.
* Autocomplete is able to complete words using the middle of words, not just the beginning.
** Try typing `x` and pressing `tab`, it completes to `exit`.
* For certain cases Autocomplete can also complete multiple words as once.
** Try typing in `l u t` which completes to `list upcoming to`.

=== Command Autocorrect
In addition to autocompleting your words, MultiTasky is also able to autocorrect your words.
Here are some other examples you can try:

* Autocorrect is able to correct when you type characters in the wrong order.
** Try typing `lsti` and pressing `tab`. This autocorrects to `list`.
* Autocorrect is also able to correct extra/missing/wrong characters that you enter.
** Try typing `lsti` and pressing `tab`. This autocorrects to `list`.
** `lisst` autocorrects to `list`.
** `dete` autocorrects to `delete`.

=== Keyword PowerSearch
PowerSearch is enabled for all commands that search for entries by keyword, like `find`, `edit`, `complete` and so on:

* PowerSearch is used automatically when regular search is unable to find any results.
** This means that if the regular keyword search rules produce search results, PowerSearch will not be used.
* PowerSearch uses similar matching rules as Autocomplete and Autocorrect. This means that PowerSearch is able to check for the following:
** substrings
** acronyms
** characters in the wrong order
** missing/wrong characters

=== Keyboard Shortcuts

There are several keyboard shortcuts that allow you to bring up or even execute commands immediately. +
Shortcuts that execute commands:

* `F1` executes the `help` command
* `ctrl` + `z` executes `undo`
* `ctrl` + `y` executes `redo`

Shortcuts that bring up commands:

* `F2` types `edit` into the command box
* `F3` types `find` into the command box
* `F4` types `exit` into the command box
* `F5` types `list` into the command box
* `ctrl` + `s` types `save` into the command box
* `ctrl` + `o` types `open` into the command box

Other shortcuts:
* `F6` brings the command box into focus for typing
