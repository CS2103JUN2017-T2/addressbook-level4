*Google Calendar*

Developer(s): Google

Author: Chua Ping Chan

Pros:

* 'Quick add' features accepts satisfactorily natural language.
* Supports recurring tasks.
* Android and iOS app available.
* Powerful GUI
** Various calendar layouts (e.g. daily, weekly, montly, 4-days)
** Supports dragging and dropping for editing entries.
* Able to synchronise with a wide range of other calendar and task managing applications.
* Data can be stored both locally or on a remote server.
* Able to search entries based on name.
* Reminder and notification feature.
* Records all deleted entries, which can be recovered.
* Provides an undo feature for the latest change made.
* Allows the sharing of calendar with other users.
* Runs on a browser, no local installation required.
* Able to add remarks and file attachments to entries.

Cons:

* Not ideal for capturing tasks that need to be done before a specific date/time, or after a specific date/time, or tasks without specific times.
* Cannot intelligently lookup a free slot to insert entries without specific times.
* Launching is slow. Requires opening a browser and then typing in a URL. A way to work around this is to synchronise Google Calendar with another calendar application which can be open more quickly.
