*API* :

.  `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
..  Some `Commands`, such as `DeleteCommand` require further parsing, which will be done by their subsidiary parsers such as the `DeleteCommandParser` object.
.  After some processing, the parser classes will create the appropriate `Command` object which contain their inner mechanisms.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is then executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an Entry) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete /float 1")` API call.

1. User requests to add a new entry by providing an entry name, and optionally entry deadlines and tags.
2. MultiTasky creates the entry and moves it to active list. +
Use case ends.

*Extensions*

1a. Some fields from the data provided by User are invalid.

i) MultiTasky shows an error message and prints the proper usage syntax and example command for adding new entries.
ii) Use case resumes from step 1.

[discrete]
=== Use case: Completing an entry

*Main Success Scenario*

1. User requests to complete an entry by providing keywords that match the entry's name/tag.
2. MultiTasky searches for the entry,then makes the modification and moves the entry to archive. +
Use case ends.

*Extensions*

2a. MultiTasky finds more than one entry with the same keywords in the names.

i) MultiTasky displays an indexed list of all such entries and asks for an index from the User.
ii) User specifies index.
iii) MultiTasky checks if index is valid, if not, MultiTasky shows an error message and returns to step 2a ii.
iv) Use case resumes from step 2.

[discrete]
=== Use case: Deleting an entry

*Main Success Scenario*

1. User requests to delete an entry by providing keywords that match the entry's name/tag.
2. MultiTasky searches for the entry, makes the modification and moves the entry to the bin. +
Use case ends.

*Extensions*

2a. MultiTasky finds more than one entries with the same keywords in the names.

i) MultiTasky displays an indexed list of all such entries and asks for an index from User.
ii) User specifies index.
