_Figure 2.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/multitasky/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPrefs` objects in json format and read it back.
* uses `StorageUserPrefs` interface from Model component to set user's file storage preference.
* saves snapshots after every data mutation (CRUD + complete, restore, open) using StorageManager.
* can save the Entry Book data in xml format and read it back using EntryBuilder from Model.

== Non Functional Requirements

. The software should work on any link:#mainstream-os[mainstream OS] as long as it has Java `1.8.0_60` or higher installed.
. The app should be able to hold up to 1000 entries without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
. The software should use text files for storage and not relational databases.
. The software should favor DOS style commands over Unix-style commands.
. The software should work without requiring an installer.
. All operations should have response time under 1 second.
. The software should be able to work offline.
. Basic commands on entries should be achieved within a minimum of 2 steps.
. Commands should be intuitive and easy to learn.
. Code should be open-source.

*Wunderlist*

Developer: Christian Reber (6 WunderKinder GmbH, Microsoft)

Author: Akankshita Dash

Pros:

* Accessible and activated easily from Desktop.
* Adds tasks in a one-shot approach (e.g. Dinner 5th July 9 pm is added on the given day and time).
* Provides addition for subtasks within a task.
* Available on all devices (Desktop, Mobile) offline.
* Can add floating tasks (tasks without a deadline).
* Supports multi-user collaboration.
* Can add files to a To-Do for greater context.

Cons:

* Only one alarm, no multiple reminders
* Cannot prioritize tasks
* Cannot block slots and release them if they become free
* Setup is a bit lengthy, and using some of the commands is not intuitive - need to Google/use Help.

=== Save storage path : `save`

Saves entrybook data to user entered filepath. +
Format: `save ./filepath/filename.xml`

****
* Filepath should use  `\` as a delimiter if MultiTasky is used on a system with Windows OS.
* Filepath will be saved in the same directory if it starts with `./`.
* Full path of the file should be specified.
* Parent folder of filepath should exist.
* Filepath should end with `.xml`.
* Filename should be unique and should not already exist.
****

Examples:

* `save /Users/usernamehere/Desktop/entrybook.xml` +
Creates a file entrybook.xml on the Desktop and saves data there. +
* `save C:\Users\<username>\Desktop\entrybook.xml` +
Creates a file entrybook.xml on a Windows OS. +
* `save ./entrybook.xml` +
Creates file in the same directory as the JAR file. +

=== Open data from file : `open`

Opens data from given valid XML file and saves to current entrybook. +
Format: `open ./filepath.xml`

****
* Filepath should use  `\` as a delimiter if MultiTasky is used on a system with Windows OS.
* Filepath will be opened from the same directory if it starts with `./`.
* Full path of the file should be specified.
* File should exist.
* Filepath should contain XML data which is readable by MultiTasky.
****

Examples:

* `open /Users/usernamehere/Desktop/entrybook.xml` +
Loads data from file entrybook.xml on the Desktop and saves this data to current entrybook. +
* `open C:\Users\<username>\Desktop\entrybook.xml` +
Opens a file entrybook.xml on a Windows OS. +
* `open ./entrybook.xml` +
Opens file in the same directory as the JAR file. +
