== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters.

Format: `help`

=== Adding an entry: `add`

Adds an entry to the active tasks +
Format: `add ENTRY_NAME [-on | -by DATE_A] [-to DATE_B] [-every day | week | month | year [NUM_TIMES | -until STOP_DATE] [-tag TAG_1, TAG_2...]`

****
* If no date is specified, the entry will contain no date information.
* `-on DATE_A` indicates an entry starting from `DATE_A` which uses the default value `default.add.duration`.
* `-by DATE_A` indicates an entry with single date of `DATE_A`.
* `-on DATE_A -to DATE_B` indicates an entry which spans from `DATE_A` to `DATE_B`.
****

*Defaults*: +
If no `NUM_TIMES` or `STOP_DATE` for a recurring entry is specified, `recurring.numTimes` is used for the number of recurring events to add to the calendar.

Examples:

* `add dinner with parents -on friday 6pm -to friday 9pm -tag family`
* `add go to the gym -on monday 10am -every week -tag exercise, activities`

****
* There are two ways to select an entry to edit: searching by `KEYWORD`, or specifying the `INDEX`.
** The keyword searches both the entry name and tags, and a found entry must match all keywords.
** The search must only produce one entry to modify. If multiple entries are found to match the keyword no entries will be modified.
** The index refers to the index number shown in the last active entry listing. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional data fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values. If that field is not provided, the existing values are not changed.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the entry will be removed and replaced with the new tags: *adding of tags is not cumulative*.
* You can remove all of the entry's tags by typing `-tag` without specifying any tags after it.
****

Examples:

* `edit 1 -on saturday 6pm` +
Edits the 1st entry to take place on the coming Saturday at 6pm, for a duration set by `default.add.duration`.
* `edit 2 -every week 3 -tag` +
Edits the 2nd entry to take place every week for the 3 weeks including its current occurence, and clears all existing tags.

Finds persons whose names contain any of the given keywords. +
Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans` will match `Hans Bo`

=== Deleting an event : `delete`

Deletes the specified entry from the active calendar. +
Format: `delete [KEYWORD_1, KEYWORD_2,...] | [-index INDEX] [-force]`

****
* There are two ways to select an entry to delete: searching by `KEYWORD`, or specifying the `INDEX`.
** The keyword searches both the entry name and the tags, and a found entry must match all keywords.
** The index refers to the index number shown in the last active entry listing. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* Deleting an entry moves it from the active calendar and to the recycle bin.
* If multiple entries are found using the keywords, the user will be prompted to confirm that they want to delete all of those entries.
** Using the `-force` option skips the confirmation step.
