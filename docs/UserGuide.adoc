== Welcome

We often find ourselves overwhelmed by different sets of tasks every single day and frequently have to spend a huge amount of time organizing and remembering what to do. However, with ProductNameHere and our smart key commands, neatly organizing such tasks become a clinch, allowing you to deal with your daily tasks with maximum efficiency!

== Getting Started

Setting up ProductNameHere is simple. Just follow these simple steps:

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` from the link:../../../releases[releases] tab.
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to the link:#features[Features] section below for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters.
* Items in `[ ]` are optional.
* Items separated by `|` indicate that either should be used, but not both.
* Items with `...` after them can have multiple instances.
* Parameters can be in any order.

====
*Defaults*

* Default values used by commands can be found in the config file `FILE_LOCATION_TO_BE_CONFIRMED`.

=== Viewing help : `help`

Shows help for all the commands +
Format: `help`

=== Adding an entry: `add`

Adds an entry to the active tasks +
Format: `add ENTRY_NAME [-on | -by DATE_A] [-to DATE_B] [-every day | week | month | year [NUM_TIMES | -until STOP_DATE] [-tag TAG_1 TAG_2...]`

****
* If no date is specified, the entry will contain no date information.
* `-on DATE_A` indicates an entry starting from `DATE_A` which uses the default value `default.add.duration`.
* `-by DATE_A` indicates an entry with single date of `DATE_A`.
* `-on DATE_A -to DATE_B` indicates an entry which spans from `DATE_A` to `DATE_B`.
****

*Defaults from config*: +
If no `NUM_TIMES` or `STOP_DATE` for a recurring entry is specified, `recurring.numTimes` is used for the number of recurring events to add to the calendar.

Examples:

* `add dinner with parents -on friday 6pm -to friday 9pm -tag family`
* `add go to the gym -on monday 10am -every week -tag exercise, activities`
* `add project submission -by 5 July 10am -tag school`
* `add write novel -tag bucketlist`
* `add clean up room`

=== Completing a task : `complete`

Finds and checkmarks a task as completed and moves it to archive. +
Format: `complete [KEYWORD_1 KEYWORD_2...] | [-index INDEX]`

=== Listing all persons : `list`

Displays a list of entries sorted by the starting time. +
Format: `list [-from START_DATE][-to END_DATE][-archive | -bin]`

****
* By default the active entries will be listed.
* The `-archive` and `-bin` options are used to list archived and deleted entries respectively.
* The default number of entries to list can be configured with the `config` command.
****

=== Editing an entry : `edit`

Edits an existing active entry in the calendar. +
Format: `edit [KEYWORD_1 KEYWORD_2...] | [-index INDEX] [-name NEW_ENTRY_NAME] [-on | -by DATE_A] [-to DATE_B] [-every day | week | month | year [NUM_TIMES | -until STOP_DATE] [-tag TAG_1 TAG_2...]`

****
* There are two ways to select an entry to edit: searching by `KEYWORD`, or specifying the `INDEX`.
** The keyword searches both the entry name and tags, and a found entry must match all keywords.
** The search must only produce one entry to modify. If multiple entries are found to match the keyword no entries will be modified.
** The index refers to the index number shown in the last active entry listing. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional data fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values. If that field is not provided, the existing values are not changed.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the entry will be removed and replaced with the new tags: *adding of tags is not cumulative*.
* You can remove all of the entry's tags by typing `-tag` without specifying any tags after it.
****

*Defaults from config*: +
If no `NUM_TIMES` or `STOP_DATE` for a recurring entry is specified, `recurring.numTimes` is used for the number of recurring events to add to the calendar.

Edits the entry matching "zoo" and "outing" to take place on 20 September. If there are multiple entries that match the keywords, no entries are modifies.

=== Find all entries containing given keywords in the name or tags: `find`

Finds entries which names or tags contain all of the given keywords. +
Format: `find KEYWORD_1 [KEYWORD_2 ...] [-archive|-bin]`

****
* The find is case insensitive. e.g `meeting` will match `Meeting`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `meeting group` will match `group meeting`
* The given keywords are matched with the name and tag of entries.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Meet` will not match `Meeting` but mathces `meet`.
* Only entries matching all keywords will be returned (i.e. `AND` search). e.g. `group meeting` will not match `client meeting`.
****

=== Deleting an event : `delete`

Deletes the specified entry from the active calendar. +
Format: `delete [KEYWORD_1 KEYWORD_2...] | [-index INDEX] [-force]`

** The index refers to the index number shown in the last active entry listing. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* Deleting an entry moves it from the active calendar and to the recycle bin.
* If multiple entries are found using the keywords, all found entries will be listed, and the user will be prompted to confirm that they want to delete all of those entries.
