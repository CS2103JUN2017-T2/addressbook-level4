== Welcome

Don't you often find yourself overwhelmed, by different sets of tasks every single day, and frequently have to spend huge amounts of time organizing and remembering what to do? With MultiTasky and our smart key commands, effortlessly organizing such tasks become a cinch, allowing you to deal with your daily tasks with maximum efficiency!

//<!-- @@author -->
== Getting Started

Setting up MultiTasky is simple. Just follow these simple steps:

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer. You may find the latest version of JRE8  from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html[here].
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `MultiTasky.jar` from the link:../../../releases[releases] tab.
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Task Manager.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all active tasks
* *`add`* `sales proposal /by 05/07/17 14:00` : adds an entry named `sales proposal` with deadline `5th July, 2pm` to the Task Manager
* *`delete`* `/deadline 3` : deletes the 3rd deadline entry shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to the link:#features[Features] section below for details of each command.
. The link:#glossary[Glossary] may be useful if you come across unfamiliar terms used.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters.
* Items in `[ ]` are optional.
* Items separated by `|` indicate that either should be used, but not both.
* Items with `...` after them can have multiple instances.
* `DATE_TIME` format is `dd/MM/yy hh:mm`.
[NOTE]
You can replace date by smart keywords like `tomorrow` or `friday`! +
`2pm` or `830am` can be also be used alternatively to indicate time

====
*Defaults*

* Default values used by commands can be found in the file `config.json`.

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `add ENTRY_NAME [/on | /at | /from DATE_TIME_A] [/to | /by DATE_TIME_B] [/every day | week | month | year [NUM_TIMES | /until END_DATE_TIME]] [/tag TAG_1 TAG_2...]`

****
* If no date is specified, the entry will contain no date information and automatically be classified under `floating entry`
* `/on`, or `at` can be used to create an `event entry`. The default value of 1 hour will be used to set the ending datetime.
* `/from` should be used in conjunction with `/to` for `event entry` that needs adjustable ending datetime.
* `/by` can be used to create `deadline entry`.
* Please be reminded that `DATE_TIME` must contain both date and time fields as described in Command Format above.
* `/every` can be used as an optional command to create recurring tasks.
* `/tag` can be used as an optional command to tag your entries.
****

*Defaults from `config.json`*: +

* The default value for events can be found as `addDurationHours`.
* If neither `NUM_TIMES` nor `END_DATE_TIME` for a recurring entry is specified, `recurringNumTimes` is used for the number of recurring events to add to the Task Manager.

Examples:

* `add dinner with parents /from friday 6pm /to friday 9pm /tag family`
* `add go to the gym /on monday 10am /every week /tag exercise, activities`

** The search must only produce one entry to complete. If multiple entries are found to match the keyword no entries will be marked completed.
** The search will be done on `active`.
** The index refers to the index number shown in the last active entry listing. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
