== Welcome

Don't you often find yourself overwhelmed, by different sets of tasks every single day, and frequently have to spend huge amounts of time organizing and remembering what to do? With MultiTasky and our smart key commands, effortlessly organizing such tasks become a cinch, allowing you to deal with your daily tasks with maximum efficiency!

//<!-- @@author -->
== Getting Started

Setting up MultiTasky is simple. Just follow these simple steps:

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer. You may find the latest version of JRE8  from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html[here].
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `MultiTasky.jar` from the link:../../../releases[releases] tab.
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for MultiTasky.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all active tasks
* *`add`* `sales proposal by 5 july 2017 14:00` : adds an entry named `sales proposal` with deadline `5th July, 2pm` to MultiTasky
* *`delete`* `deadline 3` : deletes the 3rd deadline entry shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to the link:#features[Features] section below for details of each command.
. The link:#glossary[Glossary] may be useful if you come across unfamiliar terms used.

== Features
//<!-- @@author A0140633R -->
====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters.
* Items in `[ ]` are optional.
* Items separated by `|` indicate that either should be used, but not both.
* Items with `...` after them can have multiple instances.
* `DATE_TIME` format is `MM/dd/yy hh:mm`.
[NOTE]
You can replace date by smart keywords like `tomorrow` or `friday`! +
`2pm` or `830am` can be also be used alternatively to indicate time

====
*Defaults*

* Default values used by commands can be found in the file `config.json`.

=== Viewing help : `help`

Shows help for all the commands +
Format: `help`

//<!-- @@author A0125586X -->
=== Adding an entry: `add`

Adds an entry to the active tasks +
Format: `add ENTRY_NAME [on | at | from DATE_TIME_A] [to | by DATE_TIME_B] [tag TAG_1 TAG_2...]`

****
* If no date is specified, the entry will contain no date information and automatically be classified under `floating entry`
* `by` is used to create `deadline entry`.
* `on`, or `at` can be used to create an `event entry`. The default value of 1 hour will be used to set the ending datetime.
* `from` should be used in conjunction with `to` for `event entry` that needs adjustable ending datetime.
* You may use multiple flags to replace the previous flags if you come to realise mid-typing that you've entered the wrong information. e.g `add project deadline by tomorrow tag school finals by next week` will use `next week` as the deadline instead of `tomorrow` because the last flag to indicate end time is `by next week`.
* `tag` can be used as an optional command to tag your entries.
****

*Defaults from `config.json`*: +

* The default value for events can be found as `addDurationHours`.

Examples:

* `add dinner with parents from friday 6pm to friday 9pm tag family`
* `add go to the gym on monday 10am tag exercise, activities`
* `add project submission by 5/7/2017 10:00 tag school`
* `add write novel tag bucketlist`
* `add clean up room`

//<!-- @@author A0140633R -->
=== Completing a task : `complete`

Finds and checkmarks a task as completed and moves it to archive. +
Format: `complete [KEYWORD_1 KEYWORD_2...] | [event | deadline | float INDEX]`

* There are two ways to select an entry to complete: searching by `KEYWORD`, or specifying the `INDEX`.
** The keyword searches both the entry name and tags, and a found entry must match all keywords.
** The search must only produce one entry to complete. If multiple entries are found to match the keyword no entries will be marked completed.
** The search will be done on `active`.
** The index refers to the index number shown in the last active entry listing. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...

Examples:

* `complete clean up room`
* `complete deadline 3`

//<!-- @@author A0125586X -->
=== Listing all entries : `list`

Displays a list of entries sorted by datetime. +
Format: `list [archive | bin | all] [reverse | upcoming] [from START_DATE_TIME] [to END_DATE_TIME]`

****
* By default the active entries will be listed.
* The `archive` and `bin` flags are to list the archived and deleted entries respectively.
* The `from` and `to` flags are used to specify a time period that only entries that fall within this period are shown. If `to` is specified but not `from`, then all the entries up to the later time bound are shown.
* The `reverse` flag lists entries in reverse order, starting from the entry furthest in the future. This does not alter the ordering of floating tasks.
* The `upcoming` flag lists entries in the future first, with the first upcoming entry at the top. Past entries are moved to the bottom of the list.
****

Examples:
* `list`
* `list to 10pm today`
* `list upcoming`
* `list from tomorrow 8am to tomorrow 5pm`

//<!-- @@author A0125586X -->
=== Editing an entry : `edit`

Edits an existing entry in the active list. +
Format: `edit [KEYWORD_1 KEYWORD_2...] | [event | deadline | float INDEX] [name NEW_ENTRY_NAME] [on | at | from DATE_TIME_A] [to | by DATE_TIME_B] [tag TAG_1 TAG_2...]`

****
* There are two ways to select an entry to edit: searching by `KEYWORD`, or specifying the `INDEX`.
** The keyword searches both the entry name and tags, and a found entry must match all keywords.
** The search must only produce one entry to modify. If multiple entries are found to match the keyword no entries will be modified.
** The search will be done on `active`.
** The index refers to the index number shown in the last active entry listing. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional data fields to be edited must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values. If that field is not provided, the existing values are not changed.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the entry will be removed and replaced with the new tags: *adding of tags is not cumulative*.
[NOTE]
You can remove all of the entry's tags by typing `edit entryname tag` without specifying any tags after it.
****

Examples:

* `edit event 1 on saturday 6pm` +
Edits the 1st entry of event list to have starting datetime on the coming Saturday at 6pm.

* `edit deadline 2 tag` +
Edits the 2nd entry in deadline list to clear all its existing tags.
* `edit zoo outing on 9/20/2017 12:00` +
Edits the entry matching "zoo" and "outing" to take place on 20 September, 12pm. If there are multiple entries that match the keywords, no entries are modified.

//<!-- @@author A0126623L -->
=== Finding an entry : `find`

Finds entries which names or tags contain all of the given keywords. +
Format: `find KEYWORD_1 [KEYWORD_2 ...] [archive | bin] [from START_DATE] [to END_DATE]`

****
* The find is case insensitive. e.g `meeting` will match `Meeting`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `meeting group` will match `group meeting`
* The given keywords are compared against the name and tag of entries.
* Use the `from` and `to` dates to limit the search to a certain date range.
****

//<!-- @@author A0125586X -->
=== Deleting an entry : `delete`

Deletes the specified entry from the active entries list. +
Format: `delete [KEYWORD_1 KEYWORD_2...] | [event | deadline | float INDEX]`

****
* There are two ways to select an entry to delete: searching by `KEYWORD`, or specifying the `INDEX`.
** The keyword searches both the entry name and the tags, and a found entry must match all keywords.
** The search will be done on `active`.
** The index refers to the index number shown in the last active entry listing. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* Deleting an entry moves it from the `active` list to the `bin`.
* If multiple entries are found using the keywords, all found entries will be listed, and the user will be prompted to confirm that they want to delete all of those entries.
****

Examples:

* `list` +
`delete 2` +
Deletes the 2nd entry in the active list.
* `delete pasta dinner` +
Deletes all entries in the active list that matches "pasta" and "dinner" in the name or tag.

//<!-- @@author A0140633R -->
=== Restoring an entry : `restore`

Finds and restores an archived or deleted entry back to active tasks +
Format: `restore [KEYWORD_1 KEYWORD_2...] | [event | deadline | float INDEX]`

* There are two ways to select an entry to restore: searching by `KEYWORD`, or specifying the `INDEX`.
** The keyword searches both the entry name and tags, and a found entry must match all keywords.
** The search must only produce one entry to modify. If multiple entries are found to match the keyword no entries will be modified.
** The search will be done on `archive` and `bin`
** The index refers to the index number shown in either the last archived or deleted entry listing (whichever was displayed last). The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* Restoring an entry moves it from the `archive` or `bin` to the `active` list.
* If multiple entries are found using the keywords, all found entries will be listed, and the user will be prompted to specify the index of the entry to be restored.

Examples:

* `list /archive` +
`restore /float 2` +
Restores the 2nd entry in the archive.
* `restore feed dog` +
Restores the only entry in the `archive` or `bin` that matches "feed" and "dog" in the name or tag.

=== Listing entered commands : `history`

Lists all the commands that you have entered in chronological order. +
Format: `history`

//<!-- @@author A0126623L -->
=== Undo changes : `undo`

Undo the changes made by the last command. +
Format: `undo`

* Allows multiple undo's.

=== Redo changes : `redo`

Reapply the changes removed by the `undo` command. +
Format: `redo`

* Allows redoing up until the most recent change.

//<!-- @@author A0132788U -->
=== Save storage path : `save`

Saves entrybook data to user entered filepath. +
Format: `save ./filepath/filename.xml`

****
* Filepath should use  `\` as a delimiter if MultiTasky is used on a system with Windows OS.
* Filepath will be saved in the same directory if it starts with `./`.
* Full path of the file should be specified.
* Parent folder of filepath should exist.
* Filepath should end with `.xml`.
* Filename should be unique and should not already exist.
****

Examples:

* `save /Users/usernamehere/Desktop/entrybook.xml` +
Creates a file entrybook.xml on the Desktop and saves data there. +
* `save C:\Users\<username>\Desktop\entrybook.xml` +
Creates a file entrybook.xml on a Windows OS. +
* `save ./entrybook.xml` +
Creates file in the same directory as the JAR file. +

=== Open data from file : `open`

Opens data from given valid XML file and saves to current entrybook. +
Format: `open ./filepath.xml`

****
* Filepath should use  `\` as a delimiter if MultiTasky is used on a system with Windows OS.
* Filepath will be saved in the same directory if it starts with `./`.
* Full path of the file should be specified.
* File should exist.
* Filepath should contain XML data which is readable by MultiTasky.
****

Format: `clear [archive | bin | all]`

****
* Defaults to clearing all entries from active list.
****

=== Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program. +
Format: `exit`

//<!-- @@author -->
=== Saving the data

MultiTasky data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.

//<!-- @@author A0125586X -->
=== Autocomplete

Autocomplete functionality is enabled when entering commands. Simply press the `tab` key and MultiTasky will attempt to correct/complete words that you've typed so far. +
Here are some examples you can try:

* Autocomplete will only complete your input if it's sure that that's the word you want.
** Type `e` and press `tab`. Notice how nothing has changed as there are two possibilities for this input: `edit` and `exit`. Now add an `x` behind `e` to get `ex` and now it completes to `exit` when you press `tab`.
* Autocomplete is able to figure out what you want not just from the beginnings of words, but also from the middle.
** Notice that typing just `x` and pressing `tab` gives you `exit` as well.
* Autocomplete is able to compensate for the occasional typo, so you don't have to spend time going back to change a small typo.
** Try typing `lisft` and pressing `tab`. This autocorrects to `list`.
* For certain commands Autocomplete can even work on every word you've typed, not just the actual command word.
** If you want to delete the first deadline in the list, you can type `d d` and press `tab`, and it completes to `delete deadline`. Now all you need is to enter `1` and press `enter` to execute your command.
** This goes beyond just two words in some special cases. Try typing in `l u f` which completes to `list upcoming from`, and you can continue on to type your desired starting date.

=== PowerSearch

PowerSearch is enabled for all commands that search for entries by keyword, like `find`, `edit`, `complete` and so on:

* PowerSearch is used automatically when regular search is unable to find any results.
* PowerSearch uses similar matching rules as Autocomplete. It can also do some more interesting things that Autocomplete cannot:
** It can match acronyms. So if you had an event called `Play tennis with friends`, the keyword `ptwf` would produce a match.

=== Keyboard Shortcuts

There are several keyboard shortcuts that allow you to bring up or even execute commands immediately. +
Shortcuts that execute commands:

* `F1` executes the `help` command
* `ctrl` + `z` executes `undo`
* `ctrl` + `r` executes `redo`

Shortcuts that bring up commands:

* `F2` types `edit` into the command box
* `F3` types `find` into the command box
* `F4` types `exit` into the command box
* `F5` types `list` into the command box
* `ctrl` + `s` types `set` into the command box

Other shortcuts:
* `F6` brings the command box into focus for typing
